THIS IS AN APP FOR BRYCEN COMPANY DURING INTERNSHIP TO CHAT AND SUMMARY WITH AI ASSISTANTS by NTQ

## Getting Started

-The purpose of the app (project):
    + Home-Screen of the app, which have a submit API Key TextField, an Chat Button to swicth to Chat-Screen (Chat with AI) and Summary Button to switch to Summary-Screen (Summarize Text File, Audio File... and ask Question about it.)
-This app is for a small project and this is my first project SO It is not good and Have many places that not completed too. I am sorry for that. 

## UPDATE:
- 21/07/2023: First upload about the app. First code is about the UI of Home-Screen of the app, which have a submit API Key TextField, an Chat Button to swicth to Chat-Screen (Chat with AI) and Summary Button to switch to Summary-Screen (Summarize Text File, Audio File... and ask Question about it.). But I just have code about the UI of Home and Chat Screen, so it is not completed and just the beginning of project.
- 22/07/2023: I'm  update the project app. I fixed the chat screen and add code to the summarize screen. But I have two problems: First is in the chat screen, because I run on Flutter IDE online so it can not read the ".env" file_path, so the app can not run. Second is: in summary app, I am using the 'Visibility' Widget but the Widget is not appear even after I set visisble to setState((){_variable}).
- 23/07/2023: Fixed Chat Screen and add the first AI chatbot to chat with human in that Chat Screen. This chatbot not have memory yet.
- 24/07/2023: Fixed check condition for api_key at the home screen. Fixed chat screen and do the save API KEY when first submiited at home screen but not done yet. Fixed chat screen the second time: human chat to the left, AIBot chat to the right, but AIBot not have memory yet.
